# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Features:

- Command-line application that accepts user input of their team members and information
- HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- When an email is clicked, the default email program opens and populates the "to" field of the email with the address
- When the Github username is click, that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- The application prompts include: the team member's name, employee ID, and email address
- Manager prompts include office number
- Engineer prompts include the Github username
- Intern prompts include the school
